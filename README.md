Winning football games is the most important job for clubs around the NFL to prepare for. Front office staff makes strategic draft decisions, coaches make adaptive playbooks, and players undergo grueling off-season training all towards the goal of winning the Super Bowl. Teams average about 70 offensive plays every game, and opposing defensive coordinators have to be prepared for any play thrown at them. 

Smart NFL clubs are utilizing analytics to make these crucial decisions. John Harbaugh of the Baltimore Ravens have gained an advantage with fourth down aggressiveness by hiring Daniel Stern, a Yale graduate. The Ravens utilize math and analytics on whether or not to go for a key 4th-down situation and perhaps not coincidentally, Baltimore (through Week 11) had converted 10 of 14 fourth-down plays attempted in 2019, tied for most in the league. Of the 10 drives they've converted, eight have resulted in touchdowns. Additionally they average 10.5 yard per play on fourth down, which leads the NFL. For this project, we will attempt to predict whether a team will run or pass, giving defensive coordinators key information on how to stop an offensive play.
