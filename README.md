## Data
Our data will be collected from [insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), which is an independent, non-commercial group that web-scrapes Airbnb listings, reviews, and calendar data from multiple cities worldwide. Specifically, we will be looking at data for New York City. The data provides Airbnb summary information and metrics for listings in New York City (i.e., geographic, host, review information) that will be useful in predicting our target variable price.

For this project, we use the following files from [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com):

1. **listings.csv:** contains a wealth of information for Airbnb listings within NYC (i.e., price, accommodations, host, locations, etc)
2.  **calendar.csv:** contains price information indexed by time. This will be useful to analyze price spikes for specific periods of time
